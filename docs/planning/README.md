# Planning documents

This folder holds markdown files created by the Cursor agent for planning, reviews, and design decisions (e.g. MVP reviews, solution comparisons, architecture notes).

Keep project README and user-facing docs in their usual locations; use this folder for agent-generated planning artifacts.
